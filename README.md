# Real-Time Chat Application

This is a full-stack real-time chat application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and **Socket.IO** for real-time communication. The project includes secure user authentication using **JWT** (with httpOnly cookies), RESTful APIs, and a responsive frontend UI.

## 🌐 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **React** with **Vite**
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling
* **Redux Toolkit** for state management
* **Socket.IO-client** for real-time messaging

### Backend

* **Node.js** + **Express.js**
* **MongoDB** with **Mongoose**
* **Socket.IO**
* **JWT Authentication** (stored in httpOnly cookies)
* **CORS** and **cookie-parser** for secure communication

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rituldani/real-time-chat-app.git
cd real-time-chat-app
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `Backend/` folder:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd ../Frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `Frontend/` folder:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Start the React app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Run Both Concurrently (Optional)

Install `concurrently` at root and add scripts to `package.json`.
